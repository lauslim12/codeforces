# Codeforces
Solution for many of codeforces' exercises and problemsets.
Usually done with C, C++, Python, PHP, and or Ruby if I do not get a time limit error and runtime error.

When I see a problem, I usually try to deduce its nature before attacking it. I also try to deduce the best programming language to be used to solve the problem.
