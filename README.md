# Codeforces
Solution for many of Codeforces' exercises and problemsets.
Usually done with C, C++, Python, and or Ruby. It all depends on the problem.

When I see a problem, I usually try to deduce its nature before attacking it. I also try to deduce the best programming language to be used to solve the problem.

## TODO
* Soon, I will make a folder named `implementations` where I store my algorithm implementations.
* I will also make a folder named `templates` where I template my solutions. It will be filled with like `typedef`, `#define` statements, etcetera.

## Architecture and Philosophies
* Strong emphasis on Algorithms and Data Structures.
* Coded in English, some in Indonesian (old code and old problems).
* Mostly coded with C++, but will try to use other languages for challenge and for fun.
* Procedural Programming.

## Topics
* Brute-force
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy
* Implementation
* Math
* Number Theory
* Strings
* Sortings

## Data Structures
* Array
* Linked List
* Map
* Set
* Struct
* Tuple

## Project Structure
This project is structured according to the available problemsets in Codeforces. Inside each set folder, I split them up by one hundred for clarity.

## Installations and Usage
* Don't forget to use your Command Prompt!
* First of all, copy the repository by using `git clone repo`.
* After that, do `cd forked-repo/problem-that-you-want-to-run`.
* Then, what to do next depends on the programming language that the problem is solved in.

C:
* Do `gcc problem.c`. It will be compiled and an executable named `a.exe` will appear.
* Run with `./a` or `a`. Sometimes, the executable will be named `a.out.exe`.

C++:
* Compile with `g++ problem.cpp`. An executable named `a.exe` will appear.
* Run with `./a` or `a`. Sometimes, the executable will be named `a.out.exe`.

Python:
* Run with `python problem.py`. It will be instantly run in the console.

Ruby:
* Simply execute it by running `ruby problem.rb`. Same like Python, it will be instantly run in the console.
