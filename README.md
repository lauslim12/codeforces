# Competitive Programming

Solution for many competitive programming websites. Usually done with C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and/or Ruby. It all depends on the problem.

When I see a problem, I usually try to deduce its nature before attacking it. I also try to deduce the best programming language to be used to solve the problem.

## Architecture and Philosophies

- Strong emphasis on Algorithms and Data Structures.
- Coded in English, some in Indonesian (old code and old problems).
- Mostly coded with C++, but will try to use other languages for challenge and for fun.
- Procedural Programming.

## Topics

- Brute-force
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Implementation
- Math
- Number Theory
- Strings
- Sortings

## Data Structures

- Array (List / Slice)
- Linked List
- Map
- Set
- Struct
- Tuple

## Project Structure

This project is structured according to the available problemsets in many programming websites.

## Installations and Usage

- Don't forget to use your Command Prompt!
- First of all, copy the repository by using `git clone repo`.
- After that, do `cd forked-repo/competitive-programming-website/problem-that-you-want-to-run`.
- Then, what to do next depends on the programming language that the problem is solved in and the source of the problemset. For CodeForces problems, it is possible to run it straight from your local machine. For Leetcode problems, you have to go to the problem and run it there.
